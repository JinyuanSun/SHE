# SHE(one-letter code for Serine, Histidine and Glutamic acid)
redesign protein to a Ser-His-Glu hydrolase 

This is based on  
-[backboe dependent library](http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/bbdep2010/Tutorial.php),you need to make rotamer libraries of HIS, SER, GLU on your own  
-[PeptideBuilder package](https://github.com/mtien/PeptideBuilder), you don't need to install the PeptideBuilder package, but some lines in the codes is inspried by that package.  
-[dssp](https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/gv/dssp/DSSP_3.html), a good software with long history, SHE use dssp to calculate psi and phi of the backbone.
